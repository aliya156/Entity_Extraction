Zero-Shot Learning for Entity Extraction Using ChatGPT

1. Objective
The main goal of this project was to develop an entity extraction model that does not rely on labeled training data, leveraging zero-shot learning with ChatGPT. Traditional entity extraction models require a massive amount of labeled data, which is often expensive and time-consuming. Using ChatGPT’s pre-trained knowledge, we aimed to create a scalable and efficient entity extraction approach that can generalize to new, unseen entity types.

2. Motivation
Entity extraction is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is widely used in healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and many other industries. However, supervised learning-based entity extraction methods have

limitations:
1. They require large labeled datasets.
2. They struggle to generalize beyond the entities they are trained on.
3. They cannot adapt to new domains without extensive retraining.
4. Given these challenges, zero-shot learning emerges as a powerful alternative. Using ChatGPT, a large language model pre-trained on vast textual data, we explored its potential for extracting entities without explicitly labeled training.

3. Dataset Information
For our research, we used the MT Samples Dataset from Kaggle, a collection of medical transcriptions.
 The dataset contains:
1. Medical records describing patient symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments.
2. Medical specialties to which each record belongs.
3. Keywords manually tagged in some samples.
This dataset was chosen because healthcare NLP applications demand high accuracy, and developing entity extraction models for medical text is both challenging and impactful.

4. Data Collection & Preprocessing
The MT Samples dataset was preprocessed to clean and normalize the text:
1. Removed special characters, symbols, and punctuation.
2. Tokenized text using the NLTK library.
3. The text was converted to lowercase and lemmatization.
4. Filtered stopwords to retain meaningful words.
5. Created a 'processed transcription' column for further analysis.
This preprocessing ensured that the text was structured and ready for entity extraction experiments.

5. Methodology and Algorithms
Our approach combined both supervised and zero-shot learning techniques for entity extraction. The steps were as follows:

A. Traditional Supervised Learning Approach
Used Logistic Regression trained on labeled data.
Converted text into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

B. Zero-Shot Learning Using ChatGPT
Prompt Engineering:

We crafted custom prompts instructing ChatGPT to extract medical entities.
Example: "Extract all disease names and medications from the following medical report."
Token Labeling & Classification:

Used Named Entity Recognition (NER) with ChatGPT.
Provided structured input to identify and extract entities dynamically.

Evaluation Metrics:
Compared ChatGPT’s extracted entities to gold-standard entities in the dataset.
Measured precision, recall, and F1-score to assess ChatGPT's effectiveness.

6. Results and Interpretation
Model Performance Comparison
Model Type	                    Precision	  Recall 	  F1-Score
NER Model (Supervised Learning) 	0.85	    0.80	    0.82
ChatGPT Zero-Shot Model          	0.88    	0.84	    0.86

Key Insights:
ChatGPT outperformed the supervised learning model with higher precision (0.88) and better recall (0.84).
Zero-shot learning proved effective in extracting new entities, even when they were not explicitly labeled in the dataset.
Our bar chart visualization revealed which medical terms were most frequently extracted by ChatGPT.

7. Challenges Faced
Despite its success, we encountered several challenges:
Ambiguity in Entity Recognition:
ChatGPT sometimes misclassified entities due to lack of context (e.g., confusing "diabetes" as a symptom instead of a disease).
Lack of Fine-Grained Classification:
The model struggled with subcategories of entities, such as distinguishing "Drug Name" from "Treatment Procedure".
Contextual Errors:
Some extracted entities were inaccurate or hallucinated because ChatGPT doesn’t always rely on factual correctness.
Performance Variability Across Domains:
While it performed well in healthcare, ChatGPT might not generalize as effectively in domains like finance or sports.

8. Future Scope
To enhance the model, we propose the following improvements:

Fine-Tuning on Domain-Specific Data:
Instead of using generic ChatGPT prompts, fine-tuning on medical datasets could improve accuracy.

Hybrid Models:
Combining zero-shot learning with supervised learning could create a more reliable entity extraction system.

Multi-Modal Learning:
Future work could integrate text with medical images (e.g., X-ray reports with textual descriptions) for better decision-making.

Integration with External Knowledge Bases:
Linking extracted entities to medical ontologies like UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) could improve contextual understanding.

Active Learning for Annotation Reduction:
Implement semi-supervised learning to gradually label data more efficiently.

9. Conclusion
This project demonstrated that ChatGPT’s zero-shot learning can be a powerful tool for entity extraction without requiring labeled datasets. Our study revealed:

ChatGPT outperforms traditional models in recognizing entities.
Zero-shot learning is viable for real-world applications, especially where labeled data is scarce.
Challenges like ambiguity, contextual errors, and fine-grained classification remain, but can be addressed with further improvements.
The research opens exciting possibilities for AI-driven entity extraction, particularly in domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
